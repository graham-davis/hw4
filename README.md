#Particle Pan - Graham Davis
##Music 256a - Homework 4

Ever wanted to control stereo panning with the forces of gravity? Me neither.. Until I created particle pan! 
Using this application, one can control the panning of a stereo audio file through the use of gravitational
particles.

To begin audio playback, hit the spacebar. Two spheres will appear, each representing a channel of audio. No sound
will be heard until particles are added to the environment. To add particles, click and hold (or don't hold, whatever suites you)
anywhere on the canvas. Particles will amplify the audio sphere which has the maximum gravitational force on
that particular particle. The gain (gravitational pull) of each audio sphere can be controlled using theLeft/Right keys for the left sphere, and Up/Down 
keys for the right sphere. For purely aesthetic enjoyment, universal gravitational force is controlled using the + and - keys. One can
"explode" particles from the scene by click 1 (removes left sphere particles), 2 (removes right sphere particles) and/or 3 (removes particles
from both spheres). Finally, audio playback can be paused or started at any point using the spacebar.
